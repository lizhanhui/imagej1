ImageJ is a public domain Java image processing program used internally within the client. (Full source can be found on the NIH pages here: http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ Developer resources can be found here: http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/ )

Currently, the installation of ImageJ being used by the client does not possess the same level of functionality as is present in some Canon software that is being used to control a camera as it is taking images.  Through [topcoder] challenges Omicron is seeking to replicate and improve upon the functionality of the software directly through

ImageJ for a more complete level of control over the image-taking process.

The main task of this challenge is to implement an ImageJ plugin that will cover the following workflow/requirements:

1. The plugin can be used to attach the camera to ImageJ that will interact with the standard Canon firmware
2. The plugin will create a live video stream of the current image being viewed on the camera into the software. So that the user of the Image can view the real-time images on the camera.
3. The user (who is viewing the image) can control focus and control of the lens.
4. The user (who is viewing the image) can set the parameters for the image to be taken â€“ including ISO, Shutter Speed, Aperture and White balance.
a. These parameters will be dependent on the current camera mode e.g. Manual setting on the camera
5. Then, the user can trigger the taking of the pictures.
6. The following time-lapse photography of the image taking will be configured via a config file:
   a.setting the number of frames,
   b.how far apart they should be.
7. After the user triggered the picture taking, the application will automatically save the image to the PC (the folder to save images will be configured in the configuration file).
8. During the above step, the main GUI of this plugin will show the general status indicator:
   a. Battery remaining I would imagine should be percentage based
   b. Lens status should be appropriate to the values available.

9. The values contained in configuration file can be modified from within the software we produce.
